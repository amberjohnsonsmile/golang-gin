# Joke App

This joke app is loosely based on a tutorial by Francis Sunday, which can be foud [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-web-app-with-go-gin-and-react-cffdc473576). The app uses Go, Gin, and React to display a list of jokes, which can be "liked". Visit my deployed app [here](https://serene-dusk-55955.herokuapp.com/) to get your joke on!
